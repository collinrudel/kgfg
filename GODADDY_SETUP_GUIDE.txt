  Connecting Your GoDaddy Domain - SIMPLE METHOD
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OPTION A: EASIEST METHOD (Using DNS Records - No Nameserver Change)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: DEPLOY YOUR APP TO NETLIFY
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag your 3 files (index.html, app.js, styles.css) into the page
3. Your app goes live instantly at something like: random-name-123.netlify.app
4. Click "Sign Up" to create a free account (keeps your site permanent)

STEP 2: ADD YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN IN NETLIFY
1. Once signed in, click on your site
2. Click "Domain Settings" or "Set up a custom domain"
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Type your domain (example: mrrudel.com)
5. Netlify will show you what DNS records to add

STEP 3: UPDATE GODADDY DNS (Keep Your GoDaddy Nameservers!)
1. Log into GoDaddy.com
2. Go to: My Products → Domains
3. Click your domain → DNS (or "Manage DNS")
4. You'll see a section called "Records"

5. ADD THESE RECORDS (Netlify will give you the exact values):

   For ROOT domain (example.com):
   --------------------------------
   Type: A
   Name: @ (or leave blank)
   Value: 75.2.60.5 (Netlify's IP - they'll show you this)
   TTL: 600

   For WWW subdomain (www.example.com):
   ------------------------------------
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
   TTL: 600

6. Click "Save"
7. Wait 10-60 minutes for DNS to update
8. Your site will be live at your domain!


OPTION B: CHANGE NAMESERVERS (More Advanced)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ONLY DO THIS IF OPTION A DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU

Netlify's Nameservers (if you choose Netlify DNS):
   dns1.p01.nsone.net
   dns2.p01.nsone.net
   dns3.p01.nsone.net
   dns4.p01.nsone.net

Cloudflare's Nameservers (if you choose Cloudflare):
   (They give you custom ones when you sign up - usually like:)
   bob.ns.cloudflare.com
   jane.ns.cloudflare.com

To Change Nameservers in GoDaddy:
1. Log into GoDaddy
2. My Products → Domains → Your Domain
3. Scroll to "Additional Settings"
4. Click "Manage DNS"
5. Scroll to "Nameservers"
6. Click "Change"
7. Select "Enter my own nameservers (advanced)"
8. Enter the nameservers from your hosting provider
9. Save
10. Wait 24-48 hours (usually faster)


WHICH METHOD SHOULD YOU USE?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
→ Use OPTION A (DNS Records) - It's easier and faster!
→ You keep control of your domain in GoDaddy
→ Only takes 10-60 minutes to work (not 24-48 hours)


TROUBLESHOOTING:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: My site isn't loading after I changed DNS
A: Wait 30-60 minutes. DNS changes take time. Check status at:
   https://www.whatsmydns.net/

Q: I see "Page not found"
A: Make sure you uploaded all 3 files (index.html, app.js, styles.css)

Q: The app loads but doesn't work
A: Open browser console (F12) and check for errors. All 3 files
   must be in the same folder.

Q: I'm confused about which IP or CNAME to use
A: Don't worry! When you add your domain in Netlify, it shows you
   EXACTLY what to enter. Just copy/paste those values.


VISUAL GUIDE:

Your Domain Journey:
┌─────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   Someone   │──────│   GoDaddy    │──────│   Netlify   │
│   visits    │      │   DNS says:  │      │   hosts     │
│  your URL   │      │  "Go there!" │      │  your app   │
└─────────────┘      └──────────────┘      └─────────────┘

GoDaddy = Your domain registrar (you paid them for the name)
Netlify = Your hosting (where the files actually live)
DNS Records = The bridge connecting them


NEED MORE HELP?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you deploy to Netlify, come back and tell me:
1. Your Netlify URL (the random-name-123.netlify.app one)
2. Your GoDaddy domain name

And I can give you the EXACT values to enter in GoDaddy!
